### About the lab
Lead by [Charley Wu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/charley_wu.md %}), the Human and Machine Cognition (HMC) Lab works at the intersection of Human Cognitive Science and Machine Learning research. We seek to use insights from human cognition to improve machine learning methods, while also using advances in machine learning as tools for understanding human intelligence. In practice, this often involves using experiments to study an interesting feature of human cognition (e.g., rapid learning in novel environments) and then using computational models to understand the cognitive principles behind the phenomenon. 

Experiments are typically performed online in the form of an interactive game, in the lab using computers or virtual reality equipment, or occur naturally through the analysis of real-world data. Our computational models are often inspired by reinforcement learning or machine learning methods, and are validated by predicting human behavior, neural activity, or through evolutionary simulations. 

The lab is still brand new, and our methods and interests are bound to be shaped by new lab members and by the vibrant research environment in T端bingen. 

*We currently have two open and fully-funded PhD positions. [Click here to find out more]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-09-09-JobAd.md %})*

### Research topics
Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.

Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.

We've pursued projects that involve handshake greetings, human movement, [cell-phone related parkinson's research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2012.00158/abstract), competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [meta-science analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html), data sharing initiatives, and [recording from all neurons in a mouse](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291).
