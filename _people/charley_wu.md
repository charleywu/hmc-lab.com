### Bio

I'm a cognitive scientist who is interested in the specific shortcuts and cognitive algorithms that people use to make inference tractable. Using online and virtual reality experiments, I employ computational models to predict and understand human behavior. These models allow us to understand the strategies and approximations that allow people to do so much with so little.

Originally trained in Philosophy at the University of British Columbia, I pivoted to cognitive science via a M.Sc. from the University of Vienna and a PhD in Psychology from Humboldt University of Berlin, while based at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. Prior to joining the University of Tübingen, I was a postdoc at Harvard University working with Fiery Cushman and Sam Gershman.
